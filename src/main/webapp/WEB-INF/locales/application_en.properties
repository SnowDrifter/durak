rules.content=<p>Durak is played with 32 cards\: the A, K, Q, J, 10, 9, 8, 7 and 6s from a standard 4-suit 52-card deck are used. At the start, each player is dealt six cards, which are played in a series of bouts of attack and defence. After the players have received all their cards, reveal the top card of the deck. Place it on the middle of the table, place the deck on top of the revealed card, covering it half way. This card represents the trump suit and is now at the bottom of the deck. Cards in this suit hold a higher value then the Aces of the other suits. Within the trump suit card hierarchy is maintained.</p>\
<p>When a player's hand is reduced to fewer than six cards it is replenished from the talon of undealt cards. After the talon is exhausted, there is no more replenishment and the aim is to get rid of all the cards from your hand. The last player left holding cards is the loser. This player is the fool (durak) and is ridiculed by the other player.</p>\
<p>Attacker reveals a card from his hand by placing it on the table so opponent can see. After the first card has been defended attacker may add cards to the table as long as they are of the same face value as other cards in play. Maximum cards to be defended must be as many as have been originally dealt to each player (6) or until the defender runs out of cards, whichever is less.</p>\
<p>Defender must respond to the revealed card by beating it with a card of the same suit of higher value or a card of the trump suit. If the defender has no appropriate card he must pick up the card and add it to his hand, thereby losing his turn to attack. If the defender picks up the first attacking card, the turn is over. Defender must beat all revealed cards. Otherwise he must pick up all cards in play including ones that have been beaten. Maximum cards to be defended must be as many as have been originally dealt to each player (6) or until the defender runs out of cards, whichever is less. A successful turn ends when the defender beats all attacking cards. All cards that have been revealed during this turn are removed from the game.</p>\
<p>When a defender has successfully beaten all the attacking cards, all the cards that have been in play are removed from the game. Every player must take his turn to refresh his hand by taking as many cards from deck as needed to bring his hand to a total of as many as have been originally dealt to each player (6). Attacker refreshes his hand first. Defender refreshes his hand last. If the deck has been exhausted, players who are left empty handed withdraw from the game. They are lucky, for they will not have a chance to lose.</p>
